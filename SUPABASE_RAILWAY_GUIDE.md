## Prerequisites and Account Setup

### Supabase Account Setup

Creating a Supabase account and project forms the foundation of the database infrastructure for the TIXR-Klaviyo integration. Supabase provides a managed PostgreSQL database with additional features including real-time subscriptions, built-in authentication, and automatic API generation that can be leveraged for future enhancements to the integration platform.

Begin by navigating to the Supabase website and creating a new account using your preferred authentication method. Supabase supports GitHub, Google, and email-based authentication, with GitHub integration providing the most seamless experience for development teams already using GitHub for version control. The account creation process includes email verification and basic profile setup that establishes your identity within the Supabase ecosystem.

Once your account is established, create a new project within your Supabase organization. Project creation requires selecting a project name, database password, and geographic region for your database deployment. The project name should be descriptive and align with your organization's naming conventions, such as "tixr-klaviyo-integration-prod" for production deployments or "tixr-klaviyo-integration-staging" for testing environments.

Database password selection is critical for security and should follow strong password practices including a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The password should be at least 12 characters long and unique to this project. Document this password securely as it will be required for database connection configuration and cannot be easily changed after project creation.

Geographic region selection impacts both performance and compliance considerations. Choose a region that minimizes latency to your primary user base and complies with any data residency requirements your organization may have. Supabase offers regions in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, with additional regions being added regularly to support global deployments.

### Railway Account Setup

Railway provides the application hosting platform that will run the TIXR-Klaviyo integration service. Railway's platform-as-a-service approach simplifies deployment while providing the flexibility and control needed for production applications. The platform automatically handles SSL certificates, domain management, and scaling based on application demand.

Account creation on Railway follows a similar process to Supabase, with GitHub integration being the recommended authentication method for development teams. GitHub integration enables automatic deployment triggers based on repository changes, streamlining the continuous integration and deployment pipeline. This integration also provides access to private repositories and team collaboration features that support enterprise development workflows.

Railway's project structure organizes applications and services within logical groupings that can represent different environments or application components. Create a new project for the TIXR-Klaviyo integration, using a naming convention that clearly identifies the purpose and environment. Project names should be descriptive and consistent with your organization's standards.

The Railway platform provides both free and paid tiers, with the free tier offering sufficient resources for development and testing scenarios. Production deployments typically require paid plans to access additional compute resources, custom domains, and enhanced support options. Review Railway's pricing structure to understand the cost implications of your deployment requirements.

### Required Tools and Dependencies

Local development and deployment management require several tools to be installed and configured on your development machine. The Railway CLI provides command-line access to Railway's deployment and management features, enabling automated deployment scripts and integration with existing development workflows.

Install the Railway CLI using npm with the command `npm install -g @railway/cli`. This installation requires Node.js to be present on your system, which can be installed from the official Node.js website or through package managers like Homebrew on macOS or apt on Ubuntu. Verify the installation by running `railway --version` to confirm the CLI is properly installed and accessible.

Git version control is essential for managing code changes and triggering automated deployments through Railway's GitHub integration. Ensure Git is installed and configured with your GitHub credentials to enable seamless repository operations. Configure Git with your name and email address using `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` and `git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"`.

A code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) is necessary for modifying configuration files and reviewing code. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Sublime Text, each offering different features and capabilities for Python development. Ensure your chosen editor has syntax highlighting and validation support for Python, JSON, and YAML files.

### API Credentials Preparation

Before beginning the deployment process, gather all required API credentials from TIXR and Klaviyo platforms. These credentials are essential for the integration to function and must be obtained from the respective service providers through their official channels.

TIXR API credentials consist of a Client Partner Key (CPK) and Private Key that are used for HMAC-SHA256 signature generation required by TIXR's authentication system. These credentials must be obtained directly from TIXR support team and are typically provided as part of the partner onboarding process. The credentials are environment-specific, so ensure you have the correct credentials for your intended deployment environment.

Klaviyo API credentials require generating an API key through the Klaviyo dashboard under Settings > API Keys. Create a new API key with the minimum required permissions for your integration use case, following the principle of least privilege for security. The API key should have permissions for profile management and event tracking, but avoid granting unnecessary administrative permissions that could pose security risks.

Document all credentials securely using a password manager or secure credential storage system. Never store credentials in code repositories, configuration files that might be committed to version control, or other insecure locations. The deployment process will guide you through secure credential configuration using environment variables and Railway's built-in secret management capabilities.

## Supabase Database Configuration

### Project Creation and Initial Setup

Supabase project creation establishes the foundational database infrastructure that will store all integration data, queue information, and operational metrics. The project creation process involves several configuration decisions that impact performance, security, and operational characteristics of the database system.

Navigate to the Supabase dashboard and click "New Project" to begin the creation process. Select your organization if you have multiple organizations configured, or use your personal organization for individual projects. The organization selection determines billing, access controls, and collaboration features available for the project.

Project configuration requires specifying a project name, database password, and deployment region. The project name should be descriptive and follow your organization's naming conventions, such as "tixr-klaviyo-integration" or "event-ticketing-integration". This name will be used in URLs, logging, and monitoring systems, so choose something that clearly identifies the project's purpose.

Database password configuration is critical for security and operational access. Generate a strong password using a password manager or secure random password generator. The password should be at least 16 characters long and include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Document this password securely as it will be required for application configuration and database administration tasks.

Region selection impacts both performance and compliance considerations. Choose a region that minimizes latency to your application deployment location and complies with any data residency requirements. If deploying the application on Railway, consider selecting a Supabase region that is geographically close to Railway's deployment regions to minimize network latency between the application and database.

### Database Schema Initialization

Database schema creation establishes the table structures, indexes, and constraints required for the TIXR-Klaviyo integration system. The schema design supports high-performance operations while maintaining data integrity and providing comprehensive audit trails for all integration activities.

Access the Supabase SQL Editor through the dashboard to execute the database initialization script. The SQL Editor provides a web-based interface for running SQL commands against your PostgreSQL database, with syntax highlighting, error reporting, and query result visualization. This interface is ideal for initial setup and ongoing database administration tasks.

Copy the contents of the `supabase-init.sql` file provided with the integration solution and paste it into the SQL Editor. This script creates all required tables, indexes, triggers, and initial data needed for the integration system. Review the script contents to understand the database structure and ensure it aligns with your requirements before execution.

Execute the initialization script by clicking the "Run" button in the SQL Editor. The script execution may take several minutes to complete, depending on the complexity of the schema and the current load on the Supabase infrastructure. Monitor the execution progress and review any error messages that may appear during the process.

Verify the schema creation by exploring the database structure using Supabase's Table Editor. The Table Editor provides a visual interface for viewing table structures, data types, constraints, and relationships. Confirm that all expected tables are present and properly configured according to the schema design.

### Row Level Security Configuration

Row Level Security (RLS) provides fine-grained access control for database operations, ensuring that applications can only access data they are authorized to view or modify. Supabase implements RLS using PostgreSQL's native security features, providing enterprise-grade security controls for multi-tenant applications.

The initialization script automatically enables RLS on all tables and creates policies that allow the service role to access all data. This configuration is appropriate for single-tenant deployments where the application service has full access to all integration data. Review the RLS policies to ensure they align with your security requirements and organizational policies.

For multi-tenant deployments or environments requiring additional access controls, customize the RLS policies to implement appropriate restrictions. RLS policies can be based on user authentication, application context, or data attributes to provide granular security controls. Consult the Supabase documentation for detailed guidance on implementing custom RLS policies.

Test the RLS configuration by attempting to access data using different authentication contexts. Verify that the service role can perform all required operations while unauthorized access attempts are properly blocked. This testing ensures that the security configuration is working as expected before deploying the application.

### Database Performance Optimization

Database performance optimization ensures that the integration system can handle expected workloads while maintaining responsive performance characteristics. Supabase provides several tools and features for monitoring and optimizing database performance, including query analysis, index recommendations, and resource utilization metrics.

Review the indexes created by the initialization script to ensure they support the expected query patterns for your integration workloads. The script creates indexes on commonly queried columns such as correlation IDs, status fields, and timestamp columns. Additional indexes may be beneficial depending on your specific query patterns and reporting requirements.

Configure database connection pooling settings to optimize resource utilization and connection management. Supabase automatically manages connection pooling, but you can adjust pool sizes and timeout settings based on your application's connection patterns. Monitor connection utilization through the Supabase dashboard to identify optimization opportunities.

Enable query performance monitoring through Supabase's built-in analytics features. These tools provide insights into query execution times, resource utilization, and potential optimization opportunities. Regular review of performance metrics helps identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities as the system scales.

Consider implementing database maintenance procedures such as regular VACUUM operations and statistics updates to maintain optimal performance over time. Supabase automatically handles many maintenance tasks, but understanding these processes helps with troubleshooting and performance optimization efforts.

## Railway Deployment Setup

### Project Creation and Configuration

Railway project creation establishes the hosting environment for the TIXR-Klaviyo integration application. Railway's platform provides automatic scaling, SSL certificate management, and deployment pipeline integration that simplifies application operations while maintaining production-grade reliability and performance.

Begin by logging into the Railway dashboard and creating a new project. Project creation can be initiated from a GitHub repository, which enables automatic deployment triggers and continuous integration workflows.

Railway will automatically provision a Redis instance and provide connection credentials through environment variables. The Redis service is automatically configured with appropriate security settings and network isolation.

Configure the Redis service settings including memory allocation, persistence options, and backup schedules. For production deployments, enable persistence to ensure queue data survives service restarts. Configure automatic backups to protect against data loss and enable point-in-time recovery capabilities.

Verify the Redis service connectivity by checking the service logs and connection status in the Railway dashboard. The Redis service should be running and accessible from your application service. Test the connection using the provided connection string to ensure proper network connectivity and authentication.

Consider implementing Redis clustering or high availability configurations for production deployments that require enhanced reliability. Railway provides options for Redis clustering and failover configurations that can be enabled based on your availability requirements and budget considerations.

### Environment Variables Configuration

Environment variable configuration provides secure credential management and application configuration without exposing sensitive information in code repositories. Railway provides a secure environment variable management system that integrates with the deployment pipeline and supports both static and dynamic configuration values.

Access the environment variables configuration through the Railway dashboard by navigating to your project and selecting the "Variables" tab. This interface allows you to add, modify, and delete environment variables that will be available to your application at runtime. Environment variables are encrypted at rest and in transit to protect sensitive information.

Configure the required environment variables based on the `.env.example` template provided with the integration solution. Required variables include database connection strings, API credentials, and security keys. Copy the variable names and descriptions from the template, but ensure you use actual values rather than placeholder text.

Database connection configuration requires the DATABASE_URL variable to be set to your Supabase connection string. This connection string can be found in the Supabase dashboard under Settings > Database. Copy the connection string and paste it into the Railway environment variables configuration, ensuring that the SSL mode is set to "require" for secure connections.

Redis connection configuration uses the REDIS_URL variable that is automatically provided by Railway when you add a Redis service to your project. This variable is automatically populated with the correct connection string and credentials, so no manual configuration is required unless you are using an external Redis service.

API credentials configuration requires setting the TIXR_CPK, TIXR_PRIVATE_KEY, and KLAVIYO_API_KEY variables with the actual credentials obtained from the respective service providers. These credentials should be entered exactly as provided, without any additional formatting or modification that could cause authentication failures.

Security configuration requires generating a secure SECRET_KEY value that will be used for cryptographic operations within the application. Generate a random string of at least 32 characters using a secure random number generator or password manager. This key should be unique to your deployment and kept confidential.

### Deployment Pipeline Configuration

Deployment pipeline configuration establishes the automated build and deployment process that will be triggered when code changes are pushed to your GitHub repository. Railway's deployment pipeline includes build optimization, health checking, and rollback capabilities that ensure reliable deployments with minimal downtime.

Configure the build settings to optimize the deployment process for your application requirements. Railway automatically detects Python applications and configures appropriate build steps, but you can customize the build process by adding a `nixpacks.toml` file to your repository. This file allows you to specify custom build commands, dependencies, and runtime configurations.

Health check configuration ensures that Railway can automatically detect when your application is ready to receive traffic and when it may be experiencing issues. Configure the health check endpoint to point to `/api/v1/health` and set appropriate timeout and retry values. The health check should return a 200 status code when the application is functioning properly.

Deployment strategy configuration determines how new versions of your application are deployed and how traffic is routed during deployments. Railway supports rolling deployments that gradually shift traffic from the old version to the new version, minimizing the impact of deployments on active users. Configure the deployment strategy based on your availability requirements and risk tolerance.

Rollback configuration provides the ability to quickly revert to a previous version of your application if issues are detected after deployment. Railway maintains a history of previous deployments and allows you to rollback to any previous version with a single click. Configure automatic rollback triggers based on health check failures or error rate thresholds to minimize the impact of problematic deployments.

## Environment Configuration

### Credential Management Best Practices

Secure credential management forms the foundation of a secure deployment, ensuring that sensitive information such as API keys, database passwords, and encryption keys are protected throughout the deployment and operational lifecycle. Railway provides several mechanisms for secure credential storage and access, including environment variables, secret management, and integration with external credential stores.

Environment variables represent the primary mechanism for providing configuration and credentials to applications deployed on Railway. These variables are encrypted at rest and in transit, providing protection against unauthorized access while remaining easily accessible to authorized applications and administrators. Environment variables are scoped to specific services and environments, preventing accidental exposure across different deployment contexts.

Credential rotation procedures should be established to regularly update sensitive credentials and minimize the impact of potential credential compromise. Document the rotation schedule and procedures for each type of credential, including the steps required to update credentials in both the source systems and the Railway deployment. Automated rotation tools can be implemented to reduce the operational overhead of credential management.

Access control for credential management should follow the principle of least privilege, ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive credentials. Railway provides role-based access controls that can be configured to limit credential access to specific team members or roles. Regular review of access permissions helps ensure that credential access remains appropriate as team membership and responsibilities change.

Audit logging for credential access and modifications provides visibility into credential usage and helps detect potential security issues. Railway automatically logs credential access and modification events, providing an audit trail that can be reviewed for security monitoring and compliance purposes.

### Multi-Environment Configuration

Multi-environment configuration enables the deployment of the TIXR-Klaviyo integration across different environments such as development, staging, and production while maintaining appropriate isolation and configuration differences. Each environment should have its own set of credentials, configuration values, and resource allocations that reflect the specific requirements and constraints of that environment.

Development environment configuration should prioritize ease of debugging and rapid iteration over performance and security. Enable debug logging, use development-specific API endpoints where available, and configure relaxed security settings that facilitate testing and development activities. Development environments typically use smaller resource allocations and may share certain services to reduce costs.

Staging environment configuration should closely mirror production settings to provide accurate testing of deployment procedures and application behavior. Use production-like data volumes, API configurations, and security settings to ensure that testing results are representative of production performance. Staging environments should use separate credentials from production to prevent accidental impact on production systems.

Production environment configuration should prioritize security, performance, and reliability over ease of debugging. Disable debug logging, use production API endpoints, and implement strict security settings that protect against unauthorized access and data breaches. Production environments should have dedicated resources and credentials that are not shared with other environments.

Configuration management tools can help maintain consistency across environments while allowing for environment-specific customizations. Consider using configuration templates or infrastructure-as-code tools to define environment configurations in a version-controlled and repeatable manner. This approach reduces configuration drift and makes it easier to maintain multiple environments.

Railway automatically provides SSL certificates and encrypts all traffic between clients and applications. Configure custom domains and SSL certificates for production deployments to maintain brand consistency and trust.

Authentication and authorization configuration ensures that only authorized users and systems can access the integration APIs and administrative functions. Implement API key authentication for programmatic access and consider implementing OAuth2 or similar protocols for user-based access. Configure role-based access controls that limit access based on user roles and responsibilities.

Data protection configuration includes encryption at rest and in transit, data classification and handling procedures, and privacy controls that comply with applicable regulations. Supabase automatically encrypts data at rest, and Railway encrypts data in transit. Implement additional encryption for particularly sensitive data elements and configure data retention policies that comply with regulatory requirements.

Monitoring and alerting configuration provides visibility into security events and enables rapid response to potential security incidents. Configure logging for authentication events, API access, and administrative actions. Implement alerting for unusual access patterns, failed authentication attempts, and other security-relevant events that may indicate potential security issues.
